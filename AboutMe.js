      <p>I've had a fair amount of adventures in my life thus far.</p>
      <p>I fell in love with computers when I was young. I was making websites by the time I was 13, building robots by 14, and building computers by 15. When high school ended I decided I didn't want to sit behind a text book anymore. I took to working at restaurants and buying plane tickets around the world. I bought my first one-way plane ticket when I was 21, and I've backpacked 24 countries solo since then.

      <p>I was all set to pursue a career in tech


      A four year degree was too much commitment for my 18 year old self, and the economy had just crashed. Stories were all about jobless grads with massive student loans, and I didn't feel so commited to any career that I was ready to go to that length. I decided to pursue other interests with my time, and to challenge myself to get out of my comfort zone. I had been pretty dorky my whole life, and I wanted to get out from behind a computer and challenge myself to interact with the world without a screen.</p>
//       <p>I started working at restaurants to force myself to socialize, I decided to further break out of my comfort zone by traveling by myself.</p>
//       <p>I bought my first one-way plane ticket when I was 21, and got stung by the travel bug hard.</p>
